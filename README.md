**Technologies Used** <br>
- Python 3 <br>
- Scikit-learn <br>
- Tkinter <br>
- CustomTkinter <br>
- Pandas <br>
- NumPy <br>

**Steps to Run/Execute the Project**

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies (pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy customtkinter.)

3. Run the application (python app.py)

4. Using the App:
